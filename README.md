# this is one of My First JavaScript Projects

## Introduction
Welcome to my JavaScript project! This project was initially created in 2019, but I am uploading it now to share one of my earliest works in JavaScript. As one of my first basic projects, it represents the beginning of my journey into web development and programming.

## Project Description
This project includes fundamental JavaScript functionalities and demonstrates my early understanding of the language. It may be simple, but it helped me grasp the basics of JavaScript, including:

- Variables and Data Types
- Functions
- Conditionals
- Loops
- Basic DOM Manipulation
